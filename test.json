    ¨pynchon¨: 
    `With his seventh novel, Inherent Vice, Thomas Pynchon brings 
    his readers back to late 1960s California for the third time -- 
    though the story is set in 1970. As with The Crying of Lot 49 
    (1966) and Vineland (1990), Pynchon is again exploring a 
    particular moment in America when social change seemed 
    simultaneously both possible and impossible. The hippie 
    culture of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll believed a chance had 
    arrived for a new way of organizing American politics and 
    society as the first of the baby boomers came of age, but 
    simultaneously the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon defined 
    an America that would at best tolerate the hippie ethos and 
    then later exploit it for commercial purposes.  In Gravity's 
    Rainbow (1973), the masterpiece he wrote largely while living 
    in California during the late 60s (and where he sets the final 
    scene of that book), Pynchon records a graffiti slogan from the 
    Weimar period in Germany`
